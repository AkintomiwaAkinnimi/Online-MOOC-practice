In December 2023, I made the bold decision to dive into the world of programming to make me suitable for my new career interest in health informatics.
I decided on taking online massive open online courses(MOOC) to pick up the skills I needed. My journey led me to taking Havard's CS50 and CS50p courses as well as the University of Michigan's Python 3 Programming specialization.
I have decided to post the best bit of coding those courses inspired me to do.
I hope other beginners can find inspiration and answers by combing this repository.
